# DataStructures
Practice implementing various data structures using C++.

I have several data structures I would like to attempt, sooner or later.
These can be seen in the file [TODO.md]
(https://github.com/Dannnno/DataStructures/blob/master/TODO.md).  I can't
guarantee that I'll actually implement any/all of those, but I'd like to at
least take a crack at them.  I'll probably eventually implement some classic
"interview" algorithms here.  I try to test everything using the google 
test framework.  Generate the tests by running

	$ make all_tests

and then you can run the resulting executable as 

	$ ./all_tests
