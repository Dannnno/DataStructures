Data structures I'd like to implement eventually.  Based on [this list]
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures).

No guarantees that any of these will be implemented, or that they will
be removed from this list once implemented.

Mapping types
=============
Bidirectional map
Unidirectional map
Hashmap

Buffer types
============
Buffer
Circular Buffer

Array types
===========
Hashed array tree
Parallel array

List types
==========
Unrolled linked list
VList
XOR linked list

Tree types
==========
BST
Red Black Tree
Rope
Scapegoat Tree
Splay Tree
B Tree
Heap
Graph (really these are all graphs)
Directed Graph
DAG
